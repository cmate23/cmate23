### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm cmate23, I have no previous coding experience other than a few classes in fifth grade at GA. I want to take this class because I want to major in architecture in college and I believe this class will help me prepare for the software(s) I will have to use like Rhino. I also believe our world is becoming more and more computerized (if that's a word lol) so this class will be helpful for me regardless to be able to navigate the new technology in the future. I would love to be able to code a 3D structure an understand how to manipulate code with ease. A fun porject I would like to do would be to reimagine the Starbucks store I work at and maybe make a interactive game!
